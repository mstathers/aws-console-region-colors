# AWS Console Colors

This sets the background color of the top nav bar in the AWS web console based on which region is selected. The color is chosen based on a hash of the region name. It's not perfect though and I see a lot of similar colors. Perhaps for the future it is best to be less "elegant" and just hardset some nice colors.

Tested with [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) on the Chrome browser.
